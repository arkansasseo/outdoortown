<p>This was actually an exchange. I replaced my original grow bulb after 10 years or so of service, but the new bulb worked just a few minutes and then quit. I called acf customer service, expecting perhaps an argument - because after all, it was a light bulb, and maybe i damaged it. It turned out that the customer service representative was super helpful and friendly, no problems at all, and immediately arranged for a replacement and sent a return label for the old bulb. I've already received the new bulb and it works fine. I have worked with this company for years and i've always been impressed by their selection and service.</p>

<h3 id="5">What are Full Spectrum LED Grow Lights?</h3>
<p>Commonly seen as a simple &ldquo;shop light&rdquo;, fluorescent lighting can be the effective lighting choice in your grow room. Fluorescent lights come in a wide range of colors, from the warmest of color outputs to the coolest. Varied flowering stages will require differing spectrums of light, and thankfully switching lights and bulbs is a simple process with fluorescents. Concerned about excess heat in a smaller, sealed growing room? advanced t5 bulbs and other common fluorescents give off essentially no heat. With little heat output, a unique color spectrum that mimics sunlight, like quantum triphosphor t5 lamp bulbs, and energy-efficient systems these grow lights are ideal for first-time growers as well as commercial operations.</p>
<p>The iongrid series features an innovative halo design that provides a deeper canopy penetration and uniform coverage to maximize plant yields. Includes a controller that enables precise digital dimming 0-100%, programmable light cycles, power outage memory, and controls multiple lights. Features full spectrum samsung&reg; horticulture-series lm301h leds ir diodes that are algorithmically positioned to optimize growth for all plant stages.</p>
<p>There are three major factors you have to consider before picking an led system for your indoor grow operation: 1. What are you growing? depending on their species and variety, plants have varying light requirements. Generally, full-spectrum light is essential for photosynthesis. But even for this purpose, blue and red lights seem to be most important. And plants from dry, sunny areas like the mediterranean will need more intense light than those originating from sub-tropical or temperate regions.</p>
<p>Any led lights can be used as a grow light. However, regular led lights emit less color or light spectrum required by plants to photosynthesize. Thus, it is vital to ensure that the led light you are using has enough light spectrum to facilitate photosynthesis. White led grow lights offer full spectrum and are made to mimic natural light. They also provide a spectrum of red, blue, and green. These spectra have a significant effect on root formation. Additionally, plants will generally grow under red or blue light. Let&rsquo;s have look at our latest article on what color light is best for plant growth.</p>
<h3 id="6">Benefits of using Full Spectrum LED Grow Lights</h3>
<p>Light emitting diode (led) technology has been around for a while, and they are getting more efficient all the time. The main drawback to led grow lights is their cost: well-designed fixtures can cost 10 times what a comparable hid setup would. But the benefits are great: leds last much longer, use far less electricity, create less heat, and the best designs generate a fuller spectrum of light, which can get bigger yields and better quality.</p>

<p>Growershouse has a large selection of fluorescent grow lights and compact fluorescents to suit every gardening need. Fluorescent lighting uses substantially less energy than traditional mh and hps grow lights. Fluorescents are more commonly used for propagating and mothering plants. T5 high output (ho) tubes, which are the most popular fluorescents for plant lighting, are more efficient than t8 and t12 fluorescents. They are smaller in diameter. The "t" refers to the diameter of the tube in eighths of an inch. T12 has a diameter of 12/8 inch, t8 is 8/8 inch, and t5 is 5/8 inch. Typically, the narrower the lamp, the more efficient it will be.</p>

<h3 id="8">How to Use Indoor Grow Lights for Indoor Plants</h3>
<p>I would be remiss if, in an article about fiddle leaf figs and light levels, i didn&rsquo;t mention the amazing inventions of grow lights. Grow lights are exactly what they sound like. They are fixtures or bulbs that emit light that mimics the natural sunlight, causing plants to grow indoors more like they would in the sun. When dealing with any houseplant that is super susceptible to light level changes, like a fiddle leaf, grow lights are an affordable and easy way to ensure your plant is getting adequate light exposure without the concern of issues caused by too much direct sunlight.</p>
<p>Some general information. At buylightfixtures. Com, we want you to get the best possible type of grow light system for your indoor gardening application making it successful throughout the season. Plants respond very well to natural light, they like sunlight and many of these light bulbs simulate a daylight atmosphere and provide uv light that the plants also need. Sometimes these are referred to as a full-spectrum grow type of light because it peaks in the main areas of the spectrum that is very similar to sunlight. These can be used in any number of light fixtures, it doesn&rsquo;t necessarily have to be something specialized only for grow lights.</p>
<p>Pay attention to new technologies that are emerging in the field of indoor gardening and grow lights. Scientists are studying plasma light technology and light emitting diodes as potential ways to successfully and efficiently grow plants indoors. Thanks! remember to keep your plants watered while you grow them under grow lights. Keep the soil moist but not soaked. Thanks!.</p>
<p>Several elements are necessary to launch an indoor growing setup, but lights are the most significant aspect. After all, the lack of sun exposure is the primary differentiating factor between indoor and outdoor weed cultivation. Once you buy cannabis seeds and start setting up the area where they&rsquo;ll develop into gorgeous mother plants, you&rsquo;ll ask yourself which lights will do the best job. One google search is sure to return numerous results discussing hps vs. Led grow lights.</p>
<h3 id="9">How Grow Lights Work</h3>
<p>Plant grow lights come in all different shapes and sizes, from light bulbs to full garden systems. If you're working with a smaller space, it's best to consider either hanging or mounted options, or smaller units that take up minimal counter space. (there are even models that clip onto a table!) indoor gardening systems and bigger mounted lights are good to consider if you have a bit more room to work with.</p>
<p>The system&rsquo;s signature led bead and zener design ensures your plants get the proper amount of light, even if one bulb is not working. The galaxyhydro offers higher par value and lumen outputs than similar grow lights. Enjoy a 30-month warranty for peace of mind.

Best of all, it comes with a 5-year warranty.</p>
<p>Similar to other grow lights, the key factors to consider (in no particular order) are: 1. Cost 4. Heat output grow light cost: this is a key consideration, and depends on the application. Enthusiasts may not want to spend on high end lights, while commercial growers may wish to do so. Grow light size: &zwj;depending on the space you are working with, grow light size will be a factor for you.</p>
<p>Led grow lights can burn your leaves and buds even if the temperature is perfect. The fact is that led grow lights are so powerful they can actually deliver too much light to your plants and cause light burn. And when it comes to what yields to expect, there are almost no companies that will tell you anything. In fact, most led grow light companies won&rsquo;t even talk about cannabis, never mind actually test their grow lights on real cannabis plants. To be fair, many companies selling hps lights aren&rsquo;t talking about cannabis or showing their products working for cannabis.</p>
<h3 id="10">How to Choose the Right Grow Lights</h3>
<p>If your house tends to be dark and drafty, it&rsquo;s probably not the ideal environment for growing plants. But you don&rsquo;t have to give up on being a plant parent thanks to grow lights. Grow lights can be used for houseplants that need bright light, which is not always available in every home (or in any home during the dark days of winter). And they can provide the proper light for starting plants from seed, which also allows you to choose heirloom or unusual varieties you won&rsquo;t find at local nurseries or big-box retailers.</p>

<p>Overall, the newly designed maxsisun quantum grow lights are not bad. But they leave a bit to be desired. My main disappointment is that they are not dimmable.

They are strong enough for all phases of growth.</p>

<h3 id="11">Your Options for Grow Lights for Indoor Plants</h3>
<p>Allen simon / getty images beginners often take up hydroponics because they want to grow their own food but don&rsquo;t have access to outdoor space. Although natural sunlight is the ideal lighting source for growing plants, artificial lighting for indoor systems can provide a good substitute within the appropriate color spectrum. Choosing the best lights for your hydro system can be daunting. There are many options on the market. Depending on your system size and type of plants you are growing; some types may be better or more efficient than others.</p>
<h3 id="12">CHOOSE YOUR GROW LIGHTS</h3>
<p>Now that you understand the basics of indoor lighting, it&rsquo;s time to discuss the types of grow lights available. This topic is confusing for many indoor gardening newbies. Understanding the difference between the lights helps you choose the right light to match your needs.</p>
<p>Just like any other light source for cannabis growing you need to remember a few basic tips on how to efficiently use cfl lights. Always check for the wattage or the actual compact fluorescent lamp wattage which is the real amount of watts that the cfl bulb will use to produce light. Bulbs available in the market usually have 13w to 200w and the highest would be 250w cfl bulbs. If you use 13w bulbs then you might need to use several bulbs and scatter these in your rom. But if you choose a 250w then a single bulb may be enough to light up your entire grow room.</p>
<p>Get a complete grower&rsquo;s&nbsp;shopping list for 250w , 400w or 600w mh/hps grow light! (includes setup cost, estimated yields, electricity cost and more!) first of all, you should know that an hid (high intensity discharge) grow light system isn&rsquo;t the right choice for all cannabis growers. Just like any other cannabis grow lights, mh/hps grow lights have pros and cons. Many people choose&nbsp;hid lights because they are&nbsp;ultra-powerful grow lights, including the incredibly&nbsp;popular &ldquo;metal halide&rdquo; (mh) and &ldquo;high pressure sodium&rdquo; (hps) grow light combo for growing cannabis.</p>
<p>Often thought of as the traditional &ldquo;shop light&rdquo;, fluorescent lights come in a wide range of spectrum colors. Depending on the growth stage of your crop, you might choose to use anything between cool and warm spectrum bulbs. Due to the fact that they produce little to no heat, fluorescent bulbs are perfect for compact spaces where your crops are forced to be in close contact with your lighting system. From simple fluorescent bulbs and compact lights to the further advanced t5 fluorescent lighting systems, these lights use less energy than other traditional grow lights, with the ever-popular t5 bulbs being the most efficient bulbs of its kind.</p>
