Just one more!".</p>

Yes, i remember people telling me this fact but it is a different matter now than i am here. It continues to drizzle (dare i say rain) this morning.

<p>Dying your hair is quite an intensive activity. You can do it at home or go to a salon to let someone else do it for you, but either way, it takes up a lot of time and money. Plus, you have to keep doing it if you want your hair to keep looking good. Luckily, there&amp;rsquo;s now a new trick out there that&amp;rsquo;s much less expensive and at least as effective as hair dye. All you need for this trick is a bag of potatoes! potato peels&amp;nbsp;contain an enzyme called catecholase. This enzyme is used in cosmetic products aimed at evening out skin tones.</p>
<h2 id="2">How do you eat potato peels?</h2>
<p>While you&amp;rsquo;re cooking dinner, scrape the trimmings from your vegetables or pieces of meat into a container. This could be potato peels, bones or egg shells. If you had coffee or tea, the grounds or the tea bag can go in too. After dinner, you can scrape whatever&amp;rsquo;s left on you plate into the container. You may choose to keep your food waste in your fridge or freezer before you&amp;rsquo;re ready to take it to the drop-off site. Or you may choose to use a sealed countertop container. Do whatever works for you.</p>
<p>Pre-heat your oven to 150 degrees c put your potato peels on a silicone baking sheet * on an oven proof tray. Drizzle some oil over the peels sprinkle some finely chopped rosemary and a pinch of salt over the peels toss the peels in the oil, rosemary and salt, making sure all the peels are coated in the mixture spread out the peels over the silicone sheet and put in the pre-heated oven for 5 minutes.</p>
<p>Starch, pectin, and cellulose are used in the food industry as gelling agent, thickening agent and stabilizers. Starch, a group of carbohydrates, is commercially available and produced from plants such as corn, potato, rice, wheat, and cassava. Banana by-products that can be processed into edible starches includes the pith of pseudostem and the green culled banana which are removed during fruit selection and processing (abdul aziz et al. 2011 ; da mota et al. 2000 ; zhang et al. 2005 ). Banana starches which are relatively low in amylase content, have high resistance to heating and amylase attack, low swelling properties, low solubility in water and low retrogradation, been proved slightly superior to modified and unmodified corn starch giving it a potentially higher market value (zhang et al.</p>
<p>Did you know that you can use potato peels to banish rust stains? that&amp;rsquo;s right &amp;mdash; the last thing you should do with your potato peels, if you&amp;rsquo;re not going to eat them, is make a rust-busting cleaning paste! here&amp;rsquo;s how it works: potatoes contain oxalic acid, which turns insoluble iron compounds into a soluble complex ion. That&amp;rsquo;s a really science-y way of explaining that potato peels are pretty effective at removing rust.</p>
<h3 id="3">Are potatoes good fertilizer?</h3>
<p>The key to a good crop of large tubers is loose, well-drained soil. If your garden has dense clay soil consider growing in a large container or raised bed. Plant your sweet potato slips in a garden bed that has been loosened and amended with compost. Sweet potatoes are relatively light feeders but they do appreciate phosphorus and potassium, and so i work in a little balanced organic vegetable fertilizer before i plant. Avoid high nitrogen fertilizers which promote foliage growth, but often at the expense of tubers.</p>
<p>To grow sweet potatoes in bags and containers, a 1:1 mix of rich compost and organic potting mix will provide nutrients, promote good drainage, and ensure the soil is loose enough for the sweet potatoes to expand easily. I did not test ph or add additional fertilizer when i filled the grow bag, or even during the growing process. I found it is not necessary!.</p>
<h2 id="4">Can You Compost Potato Peels?</h2>
<p>Many items can be composted, including many you might not immediately think of. A healthy compost pile requires two basic elements, &amp;ldquo;green&amp;rdquo; matter and &amp;ldquo;brown&amp;rdquo; matter. Green matter is anything that comes from plants, for example, vegetable scraps, potato peels etc. While brown matter is made up of other organic materials such as paper, card, wood chips and so on. Also see <a href="http://missouritrappersassociation.org/is-it-good-to-compost-potato-peels/">MissourTrappersAssociation</a>.</p>
<p>The ground is frozen, the garden is dormant and most of us don&amp;rsquo;t fancy trudging outside to chuck our potato peels. But ask jocelyn crocker why you should use a compost pile in winter and she offers a quick response: &amp;ldquo;why wouldn&amp;rsquo;t you compost in winter? it&amp;rsquo;s way less effort &amp;ndash; and there&amp;rsquo;s less risk of smells &amp;ndash; than composting in summer,&amp;rdquo; says the nait physics chair and community advocate for waste reduction through edmonton&amp;rsquo;s master composter recycler program.</p>
<p>I&amp;rsquo;m all about saving, reusing, or re-purposing as much as i can in my kitchen. This air fried potato peels recipe is the perfect way to re-purpose something you may be tempted to throw out. Instead of tossing the peels in the compost or garbage, you can re-purpose them into a delicious and flavorful snack. I&amp;rsquo;m all about saving anything i can from my kitchen, and this snack is a great way to avoid letting leftovers go to waste!.</p>
<p>Though vermicomposting is not an exact science, there is a method to the madness when it comes to selecting the appropriate size of bins for your household. Keep track of the amount of kitchen waste you go through for a couple of weeks in your home. Use a small can or bucket to collect potato peels, eggshells, leftover vegetables, greens, bread, coffee grounds, and any.</p>
<h3 id="5">Can You Put Potato Peels in Compost?</h3>
<p>I present my recipe for potato skins in this post. The crispy shells are a great decorative element and taste great as a side dish or snack. At the beginning you still ask yourself the question: are potato peels healthy at all or even poisonous? my grandmother always put the peels on the compost heap and did not want to eat them. In the first part of the following article we will take a closer look at this.</p>
<p>Foods that composting worms love composting worms, or red wigglers, are not picky eaters. They will happily digest a wide variety of organic plant material into nutrient rich worm castings. I put old lettuce in there, rotten vegetables, potato peels, fruit, grass clipping, and leaves, just to name a few.</p>
<p>No matter how you use your potato peels, be sure to put them in your compost bin (or bag) to give them a second life or convert them into an energy source. That&amp;rsquo;s right! organic waste can be used to create renewable natural gas. This clean, locally produced energy is injected into the gas network and reduces ghg emissions.</p>
<p>The most common question when it comes to worm farms is what do we feed them, remember this is not a compost heap in which you can chuck anything, it is the worms house and we want them to stick around. Worms eat most organic waste from the kitchen with a few exceptions. They do not like acidic foods such as citrus or tomatoes, so keep the orange peels for the bin. Worms do not eat meat, dairy or oily foods so avoid putting these in your farm as well. Starchy foods i have found get left and don&amp;rsquo;t always seem to disappear in my worm farm &amp;ndash; such as potato peels &amp;ndash; i tend to avoid these if i have other scraps handy.</p>
<h3 id="6">How to Compost Potato Peels?</h3>
<p>When it comes to potato peels you should always take alternative disposal methods than using your garbage disposal. Taking a couple of extra minutes to compost or toss in a trash bag will save you money and make life a little easier for you.</p>
<p>Usually, rats are drawn to compost piles because they are easy sources of food. In general, you should never add meat or dairy products to a compost pile because those items are a sure draw for rodents (there is an exception to this if you use bokashi to ferment kitchen waste). If they're hungry enough, though, even your potato peels might start to look pretty tempting to rats. Whenever you add food scraps to the compost bin , either dig in a little and deposit your food waste deep inside the pile before covering it over, or add a couple of inches of grass clippings or leaves on top of any food scraps.</p>
<p>Green materials are things that are alive and often green (not always). They are full of nitrogen and often contain lots of moisture. Greens break down much quicker than browns! these are the green things you can compost! carrot / potato peels paper bags.</p>
<p>Vermicomposting is a self-contained and modified alternative or addition to traditional outdoor composting. It consists of using small worms and basic vegetarian kitchen waste such as: banana peels, wilted lettuce, potato clippings, apple cores, melon rinds etc. As &amp;ldquo;food&amp;rdquo; for the worms to break down into compost. Worm composting can be done year round inside the home with just a plastic bin, organic matter and a handful of red wiggler worms.</p>
<h3 id="7">Are Potato Peels Good for Plants?</h3>
<p>Both the composition and the properties of extracts from plant materials are influenced by the solvent used and by differences in the polarity of compounds present in the plants. In the present study, three solvents were used of which water allowed a higher amount of dw to be extracted, giving a yield of 21. 7% for jazzy peels and 17. 8% for gala peels. Moderate yields were obtained with 80% ethanol (j &amp;ndash; 11. 4%, g &amp;ndash; 9. 9%) and low yields with 96% ethanol (2. 1% in both cases). Solvents such as methanol, ethanol, acetone, ethyl acetate, hexane, diethyl and petroleum ethers have been used to extract phenolics from potato peels, sometimes with different proportions of water (mohdaly et al.</p>
<h3 id="8">Can Cooked Potatoes Be Composted?</h3>
<p>Raw potatoes are not the only kind that can be composted cooked potatoes actually work very well in compost because the potatoes are cooked they will break down much quicker than raw potatoes will.</p>
<h3 id="9">Here&amp;rsquo;s Why You Should Never Throw Out Potato Peels</h3>
<p>Southern california my wife and i just peeled 10 pounds of potatoes. It seems a shame to throw those away. Anyone have any reason i couldn't put these in a bucket, mix them up with a bunch of greens, dried leaves, and re-hydrated grass hay pellets and make a meal of them for my tortoises? certainly not something i'd do very often, and i don't think i'd feed them a whole meal of plain potato peels, but as part of a mix would anyone think it would be a problem?.</p>

<p>Published: tuesday 20 june 2017 potato peel and fruit pomace (solid remains), generally thrown away as waste, can be turned into packaging material for food products like bread, indian scientists have demonstrated. Scientists at the tezpur university in assam have made thin biopolymer films from potato peels and fruit waste to store food items. The films are 0. 3 millimeters thin and can withstand temperatures as high as 200 degree celsius. They have good breakage strength and elongation capacity. Moreover, they are biodegradable and can be used to store perishable foods such as bread.</p>
<h3 id="10">How to Roast Potato Peels</h3>
<p>The first time i roasted what were essentially the mashed potato scraps, i did it as an experiment and had low expectations. Little did i know the crispy bites would vanish from the baking sheet before a pot of water on the stove came to a boil. Roasted potato peels aren&amp;rsquo;t particularly pretty, and they certainly aren&amp;rsquo;t gourmet. They are, however, a reminder that the pieces of veggies we typically discard sometimes have more potential than we give them credit for.</p>
<p>6 smart ways to reuse food scraps and leftovers save a scrap bag in the freezer. Roast potato peels. Roast apple peels. Use citrus peels to infuse flavor into foods, or freeze for later. Turn melon rinds into pickles. Blitz herb stems into a sauce or add to stock.</p>
<p>Preheat your (fan) oven to 180 degrees celsius. After peeling your potatoes, soak the leftover peel in a little cold water until you&amp;rsquo;re ready to cook with them. This removes some of the starch and keeps them from blackening. Once the oven has reached temperature, drain the potato peels and pat dry. Take a large roasting tin, and combine all the ingredients together so that the peels are coated in the oil and seasoning mixture.</p>
<p>What&amp;rsquo;s not to love about a scrumptious snack that costs virtually nothing and is so easy to make! potato peels are generally considered a &amp;ldquo;waste&amp;rdquo;. In most households, we will either throw away or compost the skins removed from potatoes to make lovely things like roast potatoes or potato frittata. But you won&amp;rsquo;t be doing that again! these potato skin chips are absolutely delectable!! i highly doubt that you can stop at one or even two or three! these are addictive!.</p>
<h3 id="11">Can you put potato peelings in a compost bin?</h3>
<p>Kitchen waste has value while i was in the middle of preparing a holiday meal, i stopped in mid-chop and looked at the big pile of potato peelings, celery trimmings and carrot scraps. &amp;ldquo;what&amp;nbsp;a shame to toss&amp;nbsp;this kitchen waste into the compost bin,&amp;rdquo; i thought. It occurred to me&amp;nbsp;i had read recipes for making potato peel broth, so i thought my pile of scraps might have&amp;nbsp;some potential. Because i was too busy at the time to start a new cooking project,&amp;nbsp;i simply stuffed everything into a plastic bag and put it in the fridge.</p>
<h3 id="12">CAN I COMPOST IT?</h3>
<p>Essex, england this may sound like a really silly question to ask, but i think my compost is nearly ready, its brown and moist, although not too wet, it smells right and it looks very much like the stuff i buy (for a small fortune) every so many months. Only thing is i have potato plants growing out of it! i do include potato peal in my mix, as it is on my list of do's and i do turn it over every so often, but i really don't want potato plants growing all around the garden, is there a way to stop this happening (apart from the obvious of not including potato peal!) or is this a sign that i am doing something wrong? or is it just a case that it needs a good dig over again and to be left a bit longer? any advice is more than welcome from all of you expereinced compost makers out there!.</p>
<p>To minimize waste in the food &amp; wine test kitchen, we recycle a lot of ingredients that people might normally discard. For instance, when making a batch of gnocchi today, the potatoes were cooked and the insides scooped out, leaving behind perfectly useful little boats. Instead of composting this leftover part of the potato, we decided to drizzle them with olive oil, season with salt and pepper and bake in a 400&amp;deg; oven on a baking sheet for about 20 minutes. Here, three awesome ways to fill these crispy, flavorful potato boats.</p>
<p>[ how to start composting (yes, even in the city) ] most compost ingredients fall into two categories: green and brown. The moist, green ones are nitrogenous (high in nitrogen), and the dry, brown ones are carbonaceous (high in carbon). Put them together, and they&amp;rsquo;ll stir up heat, with carbon as the fuel and nitrogen the flame. Both must be in balance, though. An all-green pile breaks down too fast, as the nitrogen volatilizes. It smells foul and burns crops with its caustic heat. An all-brown heap, by contrast, would ultimately break down, but very slowly. So the trick is to add some green materials, then a layer of brown ones, then green again &amp;mdash; as if you were making a high-rise sandwich.</p>
<p>Once you make this super easy recipe for potato peel chips you will never toss those peelings out again! bet you can&amp;rsquo;t eat just one of these babies. When i think about this recipe for potato peel chips, i have to close my eyes and not think about the giant towering mountain of potato peelings in my life that went into the garbage, the compost pile and other places other than into this utterly simple, totally addictive nibble.</p>
<h3 id="13">What can you do with leftover potatoes when making potato skins?</h3>
<p>If you don&amp;rsquo;t like to eat sweet potato skins or you don&amp;rsquo;t need them in what you are making (like sweet potato pie or mashed sweet potatoes), then you can use those peels in a way that ensures they don&amp;rsquo;t go to waste. You know how to easily peel sweet potatoes, and now you should see what you can do with those peels. There is no need to toss them out, because you can make a tasty treat using the leftover peels.</p>
<p>These potato skin crisps are perfect way to use up leftover potato peelings. The humble spud is a uk staple, with the average brit consuming around 130kg a year. That&amp;rsquo;s a lot of potatoes &amp;ndash; and also a lot of peelings destined for the bin. But why waste them?&amp;nbsp; potato skins are no less nutritious than their fleshy interiors and are a great source of fibre. They need to be used quickly, but this simple recipe can be rustled up while you&amp;rsquo;re busy making the evening meal. Just mix with oil and seasoning, pop them on a baking tray and whack them in the oven.</p>
<p>Fruits and vegetables: rotten or scraps napkins (unbleached&amp;nbsp;and/or recyclable) pizza crusts (but not the greasy cardboard pizza box) pulp leftover from juicing spoiled soy/rice/almond/coconut milk old spices &amp;ndash; because they are made from natural products like seeds and plants, they will biodegrade over time. Popcorn kernels stale tortilla chips or potato chips (baked decomposes faster than deep-fried) freezer burnt fruit and vegetables that you don&amp;rsquo;t want to eat anymore.</p>
<p>Scan your fridge and pull out any veggies you see that are no longer in peak condition, including floppy celery or carrots, a 3 day-old quarter of an onion, half a cabbage, etc. Roughly chop the lackluster veggies into 2-3 inch chunks place the veggie pieces into a labelled storage bag and keep it in the freezer add more veggie scraps, including onion peels, potato skins, and carrot ends to the freezer bag until the bag is full.</p>
<p>You can really put anything in an omelette, including potato peels. A perfect all-round preparation for when you have few ideas and little time in the kitchen; to make it you just need to lightly fry the potato peels in a pan and then proceed as a normal omelette. If you prefer, you can also add other vegetable peels, always saut&amp;eacute;ing them first; those of the carrots will be fine, and also the outer part of the leek coarsely chopped, or onion scraps.</p>
<p>Vegetable peelings, fruit scraps and rhuburb leaves old flowers and nettles corrugated carboard &amp; newspaper (scrunched up) toilet and kitchen roll tubes garden prunings dry leaves, twigs &amp; hedge clippings straw &amp; hay wool, cotton threads, natural fibre clothes and string feathers tissues, paper towels and napkins shredded confidential documents cooked food e.

I called acf customer service, expecting perhaps an argument - because after all, it was a light bulb, and maybe i damaged it.

<h3 id="5">What are Full Spectrum LED Grow Lights?</h3>
<p>Commonly seen as a simple &amp;ldquo;shop light&amp;rdquo;, fluorescent lighting can be the effective lighting choice in your grow room. Fluorescent lights come in a wide range of colors, from the warmest of color outputs to the coolest. Varied flowering stages will require differing spectrums of light, and thankfully switching lights and bulbs is a simple process with fluorescents. Concerned about excess heat in a smaller, sealed growing room? advanced t5 bulbs and other common fluorescents give off essentially no heat. With little heat output, a unique color spectrum that mimics sunlight, like quantum triphosphor t5 lamp bulbs, and energy-efficient systems these grow lights are ideal for first-time growers as well as commercial operations.</p>
<p>The iongrid series features an innovative halo design that provides a deeper canopy penetration and uniform coverage to maximize plant yields. Includes a controller that enables precise digital dimming 0-100%, programmable light cycles, power outage memory, and controls multiple lights. Features full spectrum samsung&amp;reg; horticulture-series lm301h leds ir diodes that are algorithmically positioned to optimize growth for all plant stages.</p>
<p>There are three major factors you have to consider before picking an led system for your indoor grow operation: 1. What are you growing? depending on their species and variety, plants have varying light requirements. Generally, full-spectrum light is essential for photosynthesis. But even for this purpose, blue and red lights seem to be most important. And plants from dry, sunny areas like the mediterranean will need more intense light than those originating from sub-tropical or temperate regions.</p>
<p>Any led lights can be used as a grow light. However, regular led lights emit less color or light spectrum required by plants to photosynthesize. Thus, it is vital to ensure that the led light you are using has enough light spectrum to facilitate photosynthesis. White led grow lights offer full spectrum and are made to mimic natural light. They also provide a spectrum of red, blue, and green. These spectra have a significant effect on root formation. Additionally, plants will generally grow under red or blue light. Let&amp;rsquo;s have look at our latest article on what color light is best for plant growth.</p>
<h3 id="6">Benefits of using Full Spectrum LED Grow Lights</h3>
<p>Light emitting diode (led) technology has been around for a while, and they are getting more efficient all the time. The main drawback to led grow lights is their cost: well-designed fixtures can cost 10 times what a comparable hid setup would. But the benefits are great: leds last much longer, use far less electricity, create less heat, and the best designs generate a fuller spectrum of light, which can get bigger yields and better quality.</p>

<p>Growershouse has a large selection of fluorescent grow lights and compact fluorescents to suit every gardening need. Fluorescent lighting uses substantially less energy than traditional mh and hps grow lights. Fluorescents are more commonly used for propagating and mothering plants. T5 high output (ho) tubes, which are the most popular fluorescents for plant lighting, are more efficient than t8 and t12 fluorescents. They are smaller in diameter. The "t" refers to the diameter of the tube in eighths of an inch. T12 has a diameter of 12/8 inch, t8 is 8/8 inch, and t5 is 5/8 inch. Typically, the narrower the lamp, the more efficient it will be.</p>

Serious growers know full spectrum fixtures can also accelerate the growth rate of plants to produce a high yield. 80w=600w with its 3800 lumens of brightness. ● indoor gardening - grow lights allow you to grow any type of plant year-round, regardless of the weather conditions outside.</p>
<h3 id="8">How to Use Indoor Grow Lights for Indoor Plants</h3>
<p>I would be remiss if, in an article about fiddle leaf figs and light levels, i didn&amp;rsquo;t mention the amazing inventions of grow lights. Grow lights are exactly what they sound like. They are fixtures or bulbs that emit light that mimics the natural sunlight, causing plants to grow indoors more like they would in the sun. When dealing with any houseplant that is super susceptible to light level changes, like a fiddle leaf, grow lights are an affordable and easy way to ensure your plant is getting adequate light exposure without the concern of issues caused by too much direct sunlight.</p>
<p>Some general information. At buylightfixtures. Com, we want you to get the best possible type of grow light system for your indoor gardening application making it successful throughout the season. Plants respond very well to natural light, they like sunlight and many of these light bulbs simulate a daylight atmosphere and provide uv light that the plants also need. Sometimes these are referred to as a full-spectrum grow type of light because it peaks in the main areas of the spectrum that is very similar to sunlight. These can be used in any number of light fixtures, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t necessarily have to be something specialized only for grow lights.</p>
<p>Pay attention to new technologies that are emerging in the field of indoor gardening and grow lights. Scientists are studying plasma light technology and light emitting diodes as potential ways to successfully and efficiently grow plants indoors. Thanks! remember to keep your plants watered while you grow them under grow lights. Keep the soil moist but not soaked. Thanks!.</p>
<p>Several elements are necessary to launch an indoor growing setup, but lights are the most significant aspect. After all, the lack of sun exposure is the primary differentiating factor between indoor and outdoor weed cultivation. Once you buy cannabis seeds and start setting up the area where they&amp;rsquo;ll develop into gorgeous mother plants, you&amp;rsquo;ll ask yourself which lights will do the best job. One google search is sure to return numerous results discussing hps vs. Led grow lights.</p>
<h3 id="9">How Grow Lights Work</h3>
<p>Plant grow lights come in all different shapes and sizes, from light bulbs to full garden systems. If you're working with a smaller space, it's best to consider either hanging or mounted options, or smaller units that take up minimal counter space. (there are even models that clip onto a table!) indoor gardening systems and bigger mounted lights are good to consider if you have a bit more room to work with.</p>
<p>The system&amp;rsquo;s signature led bead and zener design ensures your plants get the proper amount of light, even if one bulb is not working. The galaxyhydro offers higher par value and lumen outputs than similar grow lights. Enjoy a 30-month warranty for peace of mind.

Best of all, it comes with a 5-year warranty.</p>
<p>Similar to other grow lights, the key factors to consider (in no particular order) are: 1. Cost 4. Heat output grow light cost: this is a key consideration, and depends on the application. Enthusiasts may not want to spend on high end lights, while commercial growers may wish to do so. Grow light size: &amp;zwj;depending on the space you are working with, grow light size will be a factor for you.</p>
<p>Led grow lights can burn your leaves and buds even if the temperature is perfect. The fact is that led grow lights are so powerful they can actually deliver too much light to your plants and cause light burn. And when it comes to what yields to expect, there are almost no companies that will tell you anything. In fact, most led grow light companies won&amp;rsquo;t even talk about cannabis, never mind actually test their grow lights on real cannabis plants. To be fair, many companies selling hps lights aren&amp;rsquo;t talking about cannabis or showing their products working for cannabis.</p>
<h3 id="10">How to Choose the Right Grow Lights</h3>

But you don&amp;rsquo;t have to give up on being a plant parent thanks to grow lights.

<p>Now that you understand the basics of indoor lighting, it&amp;rsquo;s time to discuss the types of grow lights available. This topic is confusing for many indoor gardening newbies. Understanding the difference between the lights helps you choose the right light to match your needs.</p>
<p>Just like any other light source for cannabis growing you need to remember a few basic tips on how to efficiently use cfl lights. Always check for the wattage or the actual compact fluorescent lamp wattage which is the real amount of watts that the cfl bulb will use to produce light. Bulbs available in the market usually have 13w to 200w and the highest would be 250w cfl bulbs. If you use 13w bulbs then you might need to use several bulbs and scatter these in your rom. But if you choose a 250w then a single bulb may be enough to light up your entire grow room.</p>
<p>Get a complete grower&amp;rsquo;s&amp;nbsp;shopping list for 250w , 400w or 600w mh/hps grow light! (includes setup cost, estimated yields, electricity cost and more!) first of all, you should know that an hid (high intensity discharge) grow light system isn&amp;rsquo;t the right choice for all cannabis growers. Just like any other cannabis grow lights, mh/hps grow lights have pros and cons. Many people choose&amp;nbsp;hid lights because they are&amp;nbsp;ultra-powerful grow lights, including the incredibly&amp;nbsp;popular &amp;ldquo;metal halide&amp;rdquo; (mh) and &amp;ldquo;high pressure sodium&amp;rdquo; (hps) grow light combo for growing cannabis.</p>
<p>Often thought of as the traditional &amp;ldquo;shop light&amp;rdquo;, fluorescent lights come in a wide range of spectrum colors. Depending on the growth stage of your crop, you might choose to use anything between cool and warm spectrum bulbs. Due to the fact that they produce little to no heat, fluorescent bulbs are perfect for compact spaces where your crops are forced to be in close contact with your lighting system. From simple fluorescent bulbs and compact lights to the further advanced t5 fluorescent lighting systems, these lights use less energy than other traditional grow lights, with the ever-popular t5 bulbs being the most efficient bulbs of its kind.</p>

<p>Just to be clear, we have had great success using &amp;ldquo;white&amp;rdquo; leds for growing plants. I use 145w floodlights from aeon lighting technology that produce &amp;ldquo;neutral white&amp;rdquo; light. They consume less than half the power that high pressure sodium lights, and so produce much less heat, making them far safer. The leds produce less light per watt, but their light is in a much more plant-effective spectrum than the hps, so the leds remain economical. The experiments were using aeon&amp;rsquo;s own floodlights sold as &amp;ldquo;grow lights&amp;rdquo; that have red and blue chips, and they simply didn&amp;rsquo;t produce healthy plants.</p>
